<h3> Liquid Window is code that needs to be refactored into it's own class. It's my current effort to make a leight wieght class that allows for customization of the Title bar and the window itself. Currently the Title bar is simply a widget, drag functionality exists is in the main window area itself. I made this code to help you get going on this same journey. I invite you to clone, fork, and make pull requests. I welcome improvments and constructive critiques on my code. You're free to use this in your project.  </h3>

<h3> In its current state you can drage for movement, you can resize the window. </h3>

<h3 style = "color: green" > Liquid Window supports multiple monitors. </h3> 

<br>

<h3> Liquid Window is based on the resizeable widget code found at https://wiki.qt.io/Widget-moveable-and-resizeable but has been adapted for use as a upper level, parentless Widget. If you need a resizeable Widget this is where you want to go! This class/.h,.cpp file is called tcontiner is included in this repo for your refrence.
