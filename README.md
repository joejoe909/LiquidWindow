<h3> Liquid window is what is refered to as a Custom Frameless Window in Qt. This allows the coders to customize the look and feel of the window which you can do normally in QMainWindow class however the one draw back is QMainWindow doesnt allow you to display a custom Title bar as that is managed by windows. Using a customer Frameless window you re-write the code to allow for resizeing, drag, colors, etc.   </h3>

<br>

<h3 style = "color: green" > Liquid Window has code to allow for multiple monitor support. </h3> 

<br>

<h3> Liquid Window is based on the resizeable Widget code found at https://wiki.qt.io/Widget-moveable-and-resizeable but has been adapted for use as a upper level, parentless Widget. If you need a resizeable Widget this is wher you want to go! This File called the tcontiner is included in this repo for your refrence.
